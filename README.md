# OfficeCriminal
Basic android app for Android made by Kotlin (education project)

First Android App in Kotlin from tutorial(in java*).

App allow to add Office crimes (like dirty desk or living printer [after print] without paper) to data base and manage this data.

*I'm trying to create this app in Kotlin instead using Java
